## Mechano-Chemical Coupling in Hydra Regeneration and Patterning 
### Rui Wang, April L Bialas, Tapan Goel, Eva-Maria S Collins. _Integrative and Comparative Biology_ .(2023)
#### Abstract:
The freshwater cnidarian Hydra can regenerate from wounds, small tissue fragments and even from aggregated cells. This process requires the de novo development of a body axis and oral–aboral polarity, a fundamental developmental process that involves chemical patterning and mechanical shape changes. Gierer and Meinhardt recognized that Hydra’s simple body plan and amenability to in vivo experiments make it an experimentally and mathematically tractable model to study developmental patterning and symmetry breaking. They developed a reaction-diffusion model, involving a short-range activator and a long-range inhibitor, which successfully explained patterning in the adult animal. In 2011, HyWnt3 was identified as a candidate for the activator. However, despite the continued efforts of both physicists and biologists, the predicted inhibitor remains elusive. Furthermore, the Gierer-Meinhardt model cannot explain de novo axis formation in cellular aggregates that lack inherited tissue polarity. The aim of this review is to synthesize the current knowledge on Hydra symmetry breaking and patterning. We summarize the history of patterning studies and insights from recent biomechanical and molecular studies, and highlight the need for continued validation of theoretical assumptions and collaboration across disciplinary boundaries. We conclude by proposing new experiments to test current mechano-chemical coupling models and suggest ideas for expanding the Gierer-Meinhardt model to explain de novo patterning, as observed in Hydra aggregates. The availability of a fully sequenced genome, transgenic fluorescent reporter strains, and modern imaging techniques, that enable unprecedented observation of cellular events in vivo, promise to allow the community to crack Hydra’s secret to patterning.

## Quantifying Planarian Behavior as an Introduction to Object Tracking and Signal Processing
### Nicole C Stowell, Tapan Goel, Vir Shetty, Jocelyne Noveral, Eva-Maria S Collins. _The Biophysicist_ .(2021)
#### Abstract:
Answers to mechanistic questions about biological phenomena require fluency in a variety of molecular biology techniques and physical concepts. Here, we present an interdisciplinary approach to introducing undergraduate students to an important problem in the areas of animal behavior and neuroscience—the neuronal control of animal behavior. In this lab module, students explore planarian behavior by quantitative image and data analysis with freely available software and low-cost resources. Planarians are ?1–2-cm-long aquatic free-living flatworms famous for their regeneration abilities. They are inexpensive and easy to maintain, handle, and perturb, and their fairly large size allows for image acquisition with a webcam, which makes this lab module accessible and scalable. Our lab module integrates basic physical concepts such as center of mass, velocity and speed, periodic signals, and time series analysis in the context of a biological system. The module is designed to attract students with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. It challenges the students to form hypotheses about behavior and equips them with a basic but broadly applicable toolkit to achieve this quantitatively. We give a detailed description of the necessary resources and show how to implement the module. We also provide suggestions for advanced exercises and possible extensions. Finally, we provide student feedback from a pilot implementation.
