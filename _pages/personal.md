# Things I love and do 

## Reading 

In my time of relaxation, I read books, mostly non-fiction. However, As I am not an avid reader, I take some time to finish them. In case you want to have a look at some of the books, I try to maintain a short list of the books that I have read, currently reading and a wishlist for near future. Find the list below. If you would like to recommend some books, that would be very considerate of you. In case you are interested please look at my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23102515-abhijeet-anand). <br /> <br />


## My Blog

I also write amateur poetry (mostly in Hindi) and publish them on my [blog](https://baryonicpoet.wordpress.com/). There is no personal favourite genre yet. I just prefer to write whatever comes to my mind and has some value in it for me and my readers. Have a look at my blog. Your comments and feedback are appreciated. Thank you for your time.

## My love for music

I am an avid listener of old Hindi songs. I am a big fan of [ghazals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal) and [hindustani classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_classical_music). In my free time, I still try to play [bansuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri), a classical bamboo musical instrument. However, I am a very amateur at it and try to learn some tips and tricks from youtube.
