I love talking about science with school students and sharing my experience of being a scientist with them.

If you're a school teacher looking to have a scientist speak to your class, have a look at [Skype a Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/).\
They match scientists with classrooms (also families, libraries, scout troops etc.) for video calls based on shared interests.
I have been participating in this program since 2019 and have had a great time talking to students all the way from 2nd graders to high school seniors across the US and abroad. 

If you're an undergraduate thinking about graduate school, especially if you're thinking of transitioning from math/physics to biology, feel free to reach out and I'd be happy to share my experience.\
