I have worked on a variety of problems, in several different biological systems, under the broad umbrella of non-linear dynamics and complex systems. Currently, I work on theoretical models of ecology and evolution of viruses. During my PhD, I worked on biomechanics of epithelial tissues, using a combination of experiments and theory. I am not actively working in this area right now but look forward to getting back into it at some point in the future. As an undergrad, I worked on collective animal movement using mathematical models.

  <summary><b>Ecology and evolution of temperate phages</b></summary>

<p>When we normally think of phages (viruses that exclusively infect bacteria), we only think of the lytic life cycle: The virus enters the host cell, hijacks the host machinery to make copies of itself, eventually kills the host and releases its virus offspring that go onto infect other hosts. This picture is true for phages that are obligately lytic. However, temperate phages, in addition to the lytic cycle, can undergo a lysogenic life cycle: they enter the host but instead of hijacking the host machinery, the viral genetic material integrates with that of the host and stays dormant until some internal or external trigger switches it back into the lytic cycle. In this case, the virus replicates when the host cell divides and replicates its own genome. While the lytic life cycle involves antagonism between the phage and its host, lysogeny is mutualistic - the reproductive success of the phage depends on the reproductive success of the host. Thus, temperate phages have a complicated relationship with their hosts which leads to interesting effects all the way from the molecular to the community level, across timescales ranging from virus-host encounter rates to evolutionary timescales. My current research focuses on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this complicated relationship between temperate phages and their hosts. To do so, I use mathematical models that bridge scales - from cells to populations to communities.</p>



<p>The lysis-lysogeny decision is made at the level of individual host cells. It has been shown that the number of phages infecting a cell and host size affect the probability of lysogen formation (Zhang et al. 2021). I am interested in how this cell-level decision is regulated and how it affects the population dynamics of the virus-host system.</p> 


<p>At the population level, lysogen abundance is affected by host and resource availability. In polar marine environments, for example, lysogen abundance varies seasonally with higher and lower abundance in winters (low resource availability) and summers (high resource availability) respectively (Brum et al. 2016). To examine the drivers of viral strategies, I use non-linear ordinary differential equations to model the eco-evolutionary dynamics of temperate phages in fluctuating environments with phages of high and low resource availability.</p>


<p>Induction of lysogens - the process of a lysogen switching back to the lytic cycle - has two consequences: Its bad for the individual lysogen since lysis involves the death of that particular lysogen but, its good for the lysogen population in general because the newly released phage particles can go onto infect new host cells creating new lysogens. So, induction is harmful at the individual level but beneficial at the population level. I am interested in how these conflicting effects at different scales impact community ecology.</p>
